# Theme Chromate

The Chromate theme is a new Hexo theme that has good support for Podcasts.

It has the following feature:
- Lightweight: There are no redundant setting items, no references to a large number of third-party libraries, which ensures that it can be loaded and displayed as soon as possible.
- Responsive: The theme is built on the Bulma CSS framework, which ensures that it can be displayed normally and beautifully on most devices.
- Support for Podcasts: Without too much configuration, you can easily publish a Podcast.
- Dark mode support: Dark mode browsing on most browsers/operating systems.

If you want to open support for auto generating rss with podcasts, please install a plugin manually:
```
npm install podcast --save
```

It is still under development.
